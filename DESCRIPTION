Description: This package attempts to compare `nls` with other existing packages' functions 
    like `minpack.lm::nlsLM`, `nlsr::nlxb` and a new package `nlsj` that grew out of the 
    Google Summer of Code (2021) project: **Improvements to nls()** of the author under 
    the mentorship of Dr. John C. Nash (retired professor,  University of  Ottawa) and
    Dr. Heather Turner (University of Warwick).
